#### Office Hours
Standing office hours will be established during the first week of class. Individual sessions ca be set up with Derrick on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/derrick-schultz/itp-gans-1-1)

## Course Description

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are the current state of the art machine learning technology to synthesize imagery. In Making Visual Art with GANs students will use popular deep learning models to create images, videos, and interactive experiences. The focus will be on hands-on experimentation with style transfer, CycleGAN/Pix2Pix, and StyleGAN2-ADA in RunwayML and Google Colab. The course will cover the theory behind deep learning and GANs, using pre-trained models, dataset creation, and training custom models. We’ll look at ways to generate images and videos using Python, p5.js, as well as reacting to sound and motion inputs. Coding in Python is not required for this course, but a general knowledge of programming basics is encouraged.

## Objectives
* Distinguish between the different types of GANs and know when to use one over the other
* Learn to use pre-trained models to generate images and video
* Create custom datasets and train your own GANs
* Connect models to external applications

## Evaluation Criteria

Due to the short schedule of this class, there will be no final project. There will be a Show N Tell at the end of the class but you do not have to create work specifically for this session. Grading therefore will rely on participation and completion of the weekly homework assignments

* 30% in-class and asynchronous participation
* 50% weekly homework assignments and documentation
* 20% End of Class Show N Tell

## Required Technology
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (Colab Pro is a very good deal, but not required) or a Linux machine capable of running Jupyter notebooks and running NVIDIA GPU. Colab requires a Google account.
  * If you use Colab for training, you’ll likely need a large Google Drive plan. You may have one already through the university.
* Optional, but may be beneficial for some students: 
  * [Paperspace](https://console.paperspace.com/signup?R=W7JWC8C): Gradient or Core, pricing varies by machine (this link provides a referral code for a small amount of credits)
  * [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/): $300 in free credits for first time users, best for experienced developer
  * [Vast.ai](https://vast.ai/): Affordable GPU rentals, requires some knowledge of servers and build scripts

#### STATEMENT OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY 

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

#### STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLE

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members.  It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice.  Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.  For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook, which can be found online at: https://tisch.nyu.edu/student-affairs/important-resources/tisch-policies-and-handbooks

#### STATEMENT ON ACCESSIBILITY

Please feel free to make suggestions to your instructor about ways in which this class could become more accessible to you.  Academic accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212 998-4980 for further information.

#### STATEMENT ON COUNSELING AND WELLNESS

Your health and safety are a priority at NYU. If you experience any health or mental health issues during this course, we encourage you to utilize the support services of the 24/7 NYU Wellness Exchange 212-443-9999. Also, all students who may require an academic accommodation due to a qualified disability, physical or mental, please register with the Moses Center 212-998-4980. Please let your instructor know if you need help connecting to these resources.

#### STATEMENT ON USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES

Laptops will be an essential part of the course and may be used in class during workshops and for taking notes in lecture. Laptops must be closed during class discussions and student presentations.  Phone use in class is strictly prohibited unless directly related to a presentation of your own work or if you are asked to do so as part of the curriculum.

#### STATEMENT ON TITLE IX

Tisch School of the Arts to dedicated to providing its students with a learning environment that is rigorous, respectful, supportive and nurturing so that they can engage in the free exchange of ideas and commit themselves fully to the study of their discipline. To that end Tisch is committed to enforcing University policies prohibiting all forms of sexual misconduct as well as discrimination on the basis of sex and gender.  Detailed information regarding these policies and the resources that are available to students through the Title IX office can be found by using the following link: [Title IX at NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/equal-opportunity/title9.html).
